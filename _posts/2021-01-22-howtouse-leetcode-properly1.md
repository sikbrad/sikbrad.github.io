1. What are the most releveant problem?

what are the problems that would most likely to come up in my interview?
If you login with premium, you can sort with frequencey(how often see their problems in their interviews)
2. Understand the goal
Goal is to understand how the problem works, to solve similar problems in the future.
Dont focus on what is the solution. Focus on how to solve the problem.
Goal is to understand the thought process of the solution. "How could I, with my own head, have come up with this solution?"
3. Start with easy problems
4. Simulate the real world
When solving leetcode problem, do not solve this problem in the leetcode. Use paper. Use whiteboard.
Write the code to paper, dont change and copy the text, and try to run it.
With that, you can actually learn what are the mistakes that you make, and you will improve on that.
List all the lists, syntax errors, test fails. And analyze that.
5. Plan for when you get stuck
Send 30 mins to the problem. If you are making progress, keep working it. Give up when you spend 30 mins and you are totally stuck.
Focus on understanding what is it that got you stuck
You might missed some thought process. Or you might don't have that knowledge.
6. Summary, and last thought
Better to make incremental changes than try everything at once and giving up.
Just pick one strategy, and practice it.
